## Setup Instructions

You can use the free Community Edition or the paid Pro Edition of `elm-ts-interop`.

The result of running both of these will give you the exact same TypeScript Declaration file as output.

### Community Edition (Free)

```shell
npm install
npm run generate:community
```

### Pro Edition (Paid)

Note: in order to run the `elm-ts-interop-pro` executable, you will need to run npm install with your `NPM_TOKEN` environment variable.

See the instructions you receive after purchasing your `elm-ts-interop` Pro Edition license for how to get the value for your NPM_TOKEN.

```shell
npm install
npm run generate:pro
```
